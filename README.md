<p>- osTicket has two main URLs that we will use during this project and the next one.</p>
<p>- http://localhost/osTicket/scp - Your Staff Control Panel. This is used by Admins and the Help Desk Agents. See Figure 1</p>
<p>- http://localhost/osTicket.com - Your osTicket URL. This is for end users to create tickets and check ticket status. See Figure 2</p>

<table>
  <tr>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>- Once you're logged in to the Staff Control Panel URL, there are two different panels that can be used depending on your permissions.</p>
<p>- Admin Panel - This is used by the System Admin to confiured settings on the backend. </p>
<p>- Agent Panel - This is used by the Help Desk Agents or Support Specialists to view and work tickets.</p>
<p>- As an Admin, you can switch panels by clicking the panel name in the top right of the screen. We will be jumping between the two a lot during this project. Now, top off your coffee or grab another energy drink and lets get started. </p>

<h3>Section 2: Roles</h3>

<p>- Under Settings, leave Parent as "Top-Level Department" and name the department "SysAdmins".</p>

<p>- I know Figure 24 shows "View Only" for John Doe's Role, but that created some issues while trying to work tickets. I had to go back and change it while I was working on the project we'll do next. Changing it to Expanded Access seemed to fix the issue.😉  </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
This concludes our project. We have successfully completed the post-install configurations for osTicket. We will put our settings to the test in the next lab as we create and work tickets. Don't forget to Stop (turn off) the VMs in Azure. As always, Thank You for your time and viewing this Project. We'll see you on the next one! 😎
